# README

Welcome to MeeRank, the site where you create and share quick ranks. Songs, albums, movies, TV shows, people, you name it. We have a great search system and you can create ranks quite easily. You can add descriptions to these ranks and then share them on your favourite social media platforms.
You can also rank and comment other people's ranks, to create the best rank there ever was.
You will find trending ranks and controversial ranks on the homepage. You can follow users and recieve notifications when they post new ranks, and you can share your ranks even when you are commenting on another rank, to share your own opinion.
